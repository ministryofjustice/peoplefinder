        browse the site.

        Cookies are used to:

        * keep you logged into the website
        * measure how you use the website so it can be updated and improved
          based on your needs
        * remember the notifications you’ve seen so that we don’t show them to
          you again

        # How cookies are used on People Finder

        ## Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)

        We use Google Analytics software to collect information about how you
        use People Finder.
        We do this to help make sure the site is meeting the needs of its users
        and to [help us make improvements][improvements].

        Google Analytics stores information about:

        * the pages you visit on People Finder
        * how long you spend on each People Finder page 
        * how you got to the site  
        * what you click on while you’re visiting the site

        We don’t collect or store your personal information (eg your name or
        address) so this information can’t be used to identify who you are.

        We don’t allow Google to use or share our analytics data.

        You can [opt out of Google Analytics cookies][google-optout].

        ## Our introductory message

        You may see a pop-up welcome message when you first visit People
        Finder.
        We’ll store a cookie so that your computer knows you’ve seen it and
        knows not to show it again.

        ## Sessions

        People Finder will store a cookie when you log into the site to open a
        session.
        This cookie is stored so that you don’t need to log in every time you
        visit the site.
        If you are working on a government machine, you may find that your
        cookies are cleared automatically every time you turn off or log out of
        your machine.
        This will mean you need to log into People Finder again.
